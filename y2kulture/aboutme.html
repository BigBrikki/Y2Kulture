                            <p>I'm passionate about Y2K music and the early 2000s future aesthetic. I have a deep love for the innovative sounds and bold visual styles of this era, and I immerse myself in the nostalgia and futuristic vibes that defined the turn of the millennium. My passion drives me to explore and curate music, fashion, and art that capture the essence of this unique period. Whether it's through my meticulously crafted playlists or my collection of retro-futuristic memorabilia, I strive to bring the spirit of the early 2000s to life, inspiring others to appreciate the creativity and optimism of that vibrant time.</p>

                    <h3>How did I get started?</h3>
                    <p>I started by making simple beats by cutting up sampled in FL Studio (which i still use to this day). From there, I collaborated with other producers that focused on early 2000s jungle tracks, which i took a shining to. Since then ive almost fully moved over to producing EDM, aside from the occasional beat like the good ol' days. </p>
                    <h3>How did I make progress?</h3>
                    <p>Practice makes perfect! I've made tons of music. I remember going on Youtube and following tutorials on how to produce various subgenres of EDM. Each time I did this, I retained a bit more knowledge and was able to apply that to solo projects that I would work on.</p>
                    <p>
                    Most importantly, is consistency. I've developed music for years and years, you are bound to improve if you do the same. Oh, also, don't get in the way of your own music. Get creative, don't care so much about how others will receive it. just make stuff you like.
